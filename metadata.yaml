description: <p><B>Framed for murder, Lupin must clear his name or face the gallows
  </B><BR /> Millionaire diamond collector Rudolf Kesselbach is in a Paris hotel room,
  contemplating the stroke of genius that is about to make him one of the wealthiest
  men in Europe, when a shadow steals into the room&#8212;a shadow with fine clothes,
  an easy smile, and a revolver pointed at Kesselbach's chest. The intruder's name,
  he says, is Ars&egrave;ne Lupin.<BR /> <BR /> A few hours later, Kesselbach is found
  dead on the floor, Lupin's calling card pinned to his chest. With the police hot
  on his trail, the master jewel thief must use every ounce of his genius to escape
  their traps and find the man responsible for the murder. But as Lupin soon discovers,
  his freedom is not all that is at stake. The fate of Europe hangs in the balance
  as well.<BR /> <BR /> This ebook features a new introduction by Otto Penzler and
  has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.<BR
